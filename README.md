FRED API to PostgreSQL ETL Pipeline
This project provides a simple and efficient ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline to retrieve Non-Farm Payrolls (PAYEMS) data from the FRED API, calculate month-over-month changes, and load the final dataset into a PostgreSQL database.

The pipeline is designed to be a straightforward example for anyone looking to connect a public API to a relational database for business intelligence or data analysis purposes.
